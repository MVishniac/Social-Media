# EP Recruitment Video
## August 19th, 2015

- 5 to 10 minutes long
- testimonials form past volunteers
- something major recruiters can bring with them to law firms
- look at the 50th anniversary video
- have several months
 - can be very deliberate with this
- don't focus on the command center as much as hotline and field in the polling places
 - maybe even overstate the field position
- cheerleading
- some logistics
 - BRIEF EP summary?
 - 40 second of Marcia or Chris talking about EP and why it's important
- volunteers helping people at polling centers
- volunteers on the phone
- is this just for law firms or a wider audience?
 - would something this serious be appropriate for wide sharing?
 - maybe make 2 videos?
   - incredibly targeted audience should make it easier
   - second should be targeted at grassroots partners
- grassroots partners might not even use a video we made them because it's not our area
- could this be useful for conferences as well
- what do lawyers look for with pro-bono and volunteer opportunities?
 - Eduardo has this "somewhere"
 - professional development
- focus on NON-PARTISAN part
- this should be very polished, professional, formal, and serious
 - definitely have a set schedule of who is being talked to when so people can know ahead of time and look their best
- Gregg knows the guy who did the 50th video or something?
- can pull some clips from the 50th anniversary video
 - Rose has on her mac but it's formatted for mac
 - may be able to download from youtube if posted privately
 - may be able to open in Adobe anyway?
- effective use of angles when shooting
- DO NOT use any clips of Barbara
- FL, OH, NY  firms
- does CAP have a studio?
- can we use Brookings' studio space?
- must make sure that studio space doesn't have organization's logo as only background
- talk to people who dealt with crazy shit in previous election years

- check in three weeks from now
- you need to figure out where the filming is going to happen
- Eduardo will have a storyboard written up
- Rose will ask staffers about key volunteers to talk to who might have great stories


goal: how many people can we recruit with this
    DO NOT LET CHRIS BE IN VIDEO, EVER



- cost estimate for good clip on camera
