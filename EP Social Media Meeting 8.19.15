# Election Protection Social Media Meeting
## August 19th, 2015

### Facebook
- Who is our target audience?
 - Young people and women
   - Women tend to be the ones more connected to the community
 - No one over 65
 - Focus on 18-35 year old women (of color)
   - obviously men are important too but less tied into community
   - seniors won't have social media
   - usually single
 - We currently are biggest with the older female crowd
   - old is likely because of lawyers liking the page
   - likely because of mostly sharing news articles
 - Sharing with coalition pages
   - Finding way to coordinate with partners that have pages with younger crowd
- Strategy
 - Partnering with thought leaders in the minority communities
 - Media
 - Partner with other pages for certain holidays
 - Share fewer news articles on a daily basis
   - Still share important ones
   - Share more news around important issues or just before the election
 - More original content
   - Images that partners can share

### Twitter
 - Law engagement rate
   - what is the average for non-profit organizations
 - Targeting younger women should be the key to way better numbers
   - they use Twitter more
 - WAY more male followers
 - Should we target lower income households or not
   - do they even use twitter?
